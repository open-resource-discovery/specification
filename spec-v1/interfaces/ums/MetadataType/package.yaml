  description: "A [**Package**](../concepts/grouping-and-bundling#package) organizes a set of related resources together, by publishing and catalog presentation concerns.\n\nThe Package can also be used to indicate which products or vendors provided the packaged resources.\nFor partner or customer content, the package can indicate this via the `vendor` and `partOfProducts` assignments.\nIn any case, the Package `ordID` namespace MUST reflect the namespace of the providing application (which hosts the resource), not the resource definition owner, which could be a customer or partner.\n\nA package SHOULD contain at least one resource. Avoid empty packages.\n\nThe package assignment of a resource MAY change, so consumers MUST not rely on this to be stable.\n\nA package does not have a `visibility` property.\nWhether it is displayed is decided by the fact, whether it contains any visible resources according to the visibility role of the aggregator.\n\nTo learn more about the concept and further guidance, see [Package](../concepts/grouping-and-bundling#package)."
