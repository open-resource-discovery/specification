  description: "An [Integration Dependency](../concepts/integration-dependency) states that the described system (self) can integrate with external systems (integration target) to achieve an integration purpose.\nThe purpose could be to enable a certain feature or integration scenario, but it could also be a mandatory prerequisite for the described system to work.\n\nThe integration dependency includes a list of individual **aspects** that the integration consists of.\nAspects are an \"ingredient\" for the integration scenario (and are logically combined with AND condition).\nEach aspect can express alternatives (OR condition) on what API and event resources can be used to achieve the same outcome.\n\nThe direction of connection establishment, data flow is not directly implied and needs to be inferred from the referenced resources.\n\nIt is not in scope for the Integration Dependency to describe scenarios that external consumers have with the own exposed resources.\nThis would overstep the boundary of self-description.\n\nIf an integration scenario consists of two sides integration with each other, each need to describe its own part in it as an Integration Dependency.\nTherefore, if an integration with multiple types of systems need to be setup, this SHOULD be separated into distinct Integration Dependencies.\n\nAn integration dependency is also not meant to describe a bigger process.\nInstead it focuses on the technical necessaries to create an integration for one particular purpose.\n\nTo learn more about the concept, see [Integration Dependency](../concepts/integration-dependency)."
