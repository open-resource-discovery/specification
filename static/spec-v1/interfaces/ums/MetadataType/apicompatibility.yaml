      description: "Specifies the maximum version of the interface contract that this resource is compatible with. Even if the interface contract evolves compatible, this resource will not be compatible with versions beyond the specified one.\nThis is important to consider, given the example of an API version 1.0, that has the fields A and B. Being compatible with version 1.0 means to have exactly the fields A and B and potential tenant specific extensions in a dedicated namespace.\nIf an API contract changes to version 1.1 compatible by adding field C, the API declaring compatibility towards 1.0, will miss field C. Only if adopting the contract of 1.1 with having fields A, B, and C, such an API is also\ncompatible with version 1.1 of the contract. However, a client relying on version 1.0 of the contract, can still work with the API being compatible with version 1.1 of the contract.\n\nFollowing the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) standard, patch versions (x.y.Z) must not have impact on the schema/contract. Therefore, the maxVersion are only the major.minor parts of a semantic version."
