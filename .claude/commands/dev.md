description: Start the local development server with hot reload
---

Run `npm start` to start the Docusaurus development server.

This will:
1. Start a local web server (typically on http://localhost:3000)
2. Open the documentation site in a browser
3. Watch for file changes and auto-reload

This is useful for:
- Previewing documentation changes in real-time
- Testing the site locally before deploying
- Iterating on content and styling

Press Ctrl+C to stop the server when done.
